    <p>Background: There is a clinical need to improve monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) disease activity. Despite being used regularly in European countries, intestinal ultrasound (IUS) has been implemented less in the United States for unclear reasons. Aims: The aim of this study is to illustrate how IUS can be used as a clinical decision-making tool in an American IBD cohort. Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis evaluated patients with IBD seen at our institution who underwent IUS as part of routine evaluation of their IBD from July 2020 to March 2022. To evaluate the clinical utility of IUS for different patient populations and against more frequently used measures of inflammation, we compared patient demographics, inflammatory markers, clinical scores, and medications between patients in remission and those with active inflammation. Treatment plans between the two groups were compared and we analyzed patients with follow-up IUS visits to validate treatment plan decisions at initial evaluation. Results: Out of 148 total patients with IUS, we found that 62.1% (N=92) of our patients had active disease and 37.9% (N=56) were in remission. UCAI and Mayo scores were both significantly correlated with IUS findings. The treatment plan was significantly correlated with IUS findings (p=0.004). At follow-up, we observed an overall decrease in intestinal thickening, improvements in vascular flow, and mural stratification. Conclusion: Clinical decisions incorporating IUS findings effectively reduced inflammation in our IBD patients. IUS should be strongly considered by IBD clinicians in the United States for monitoring disease activity in IBD.

    <p>Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) offers a safe, noninvasive, point-of-care tool for diagnosing and monitoring disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IUS is used widely in Europe and Canada for IBD, but it remains underutilized in the United States. Growing interest in IUS in the United States has prompted many IBD centers to train their faculty in IUS. This, however, raises questions about how to effectively use this new tool in the United States, which does not use a social medicine model like those implemented in Europe and Canada. Here, we provide a practical framework for incorporating IUS in an IBD practice in the United States, including training requirements, equipment, and protocols for implementing IUS in daily practice.

    <p>Background: Considerable research supports an important role for the microbiome and/or microbiome–host immune system interactions in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Consequently, microbiota-modulating interventions, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have attracted interest in the management of IBD, including ulcerative colitis (UC). Summary: While the clinical response to FMT in UC has varied between different studies, results to date may offer guidance towards optimal use of FMT. Thus, increased microbiome biodiversity, the presence of short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, Clostridium Cluster IV and XIVa, Odoribacter splanchnicus and reduced levels of Caudovirales bacteriophages have been identified as characteristics of the donor microbiome that predict a positive response. However, inconsistency in FMT protocol between studies confounds their interpretation, so it is currently difficult to predict response and premature to recommend FMT, in general, as a treatment for UC. Additional randomized controlled trials designed based on previous findings and employing a standardized protocol are needed to define the role of FMT in the management of UC. Key Messages: There is a well-developed rationale for the use of microbiome-modulating interventions in UC. Despite variations in study protocol and limitations in study design that confound their interpretation, FMT seems to benefit patients with UC, overall. Available data identify factors predicting FMT response and should lead to the development of optimal FMT study protocols.

    <p>Several biologic therapies have been approved for enteric diseases. We evaluate each biologic’s role based on their mechanism of action in treating these conditions. This review examines data on efficacy and safety, as well as considerations for using these therapies in clinical practice in inflammatory bowel diseases, enteric infections—specifically Clostridioides difficile colitis—and potentially in the increasingly prevalent disorder of eosinophilic esophagitis. When choosing an appropriate therapy, it is important to assess patient severity, as most biologics are approved for those with moderate to severe disease activity. With many years of data from clinical trials and real-world experience, these therapies have been shown to improve outcomes overall in enteric diseases, contributing to more options for our patients.
