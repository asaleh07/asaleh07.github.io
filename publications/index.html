    <p>Introduction: We have limited data on the response of the SARS-CoV2 vaccine on patients on immunosuppressive therapies. However, there is concern that the vaccination may not be as effective based on preliminary information from transplant patients. In inflammatory bowel disease, many patients are on biologic therapies to maintain remission. Although the currently approved vaccines are considered safe to use in immunosuppression as they are killed vaccines, we have limited data on the effectiveness in preventing COVID infection in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Case Description/Methods: We present a case report on a 39-year-old female with Crohn's disease who was vaccinated against COVID using the Pfizer vaccine. Two months after vaccination, she developed symptoms of COVID of fever, abdominal cramping, and nausea. She recovered without any sequelae after 8 days. She has been on adalimumab 40mg every two weeks since 2016, previously on vedolizumab, but had worsening gastroparesis. SARS-COV2 antibody titers were not evaluated in this patient after vaccination or before her known infection. Although this was reported in only one of our patients seen in our tertiary referral IBD center, this raises concern of lower efficacy of the SARS-CoV2 vaccination in those on biologic therapy especially anti-TNF treatment such as adalimumab.
    Discussion: Further evaluation on vaccine response should be considered for future research and our IBD patients on immunosuppressive therapy must be educated on the possibility of getting COVID after exposure despite vaccination. Furthermore, this case highlights the individualization of care that should be provided for individuals with IBD amidst a pandemic.

    <p>Introduction: Patients with IBD often present with abdominal pain and diarrhea. However, distinguishing between active IBD, acute enteric infection, or the coexistence of both, can be difficult. It is unknown whether enteric infection may be a manifestation of active disease in patients with IBD, and only a few studies have evaluated endoscopic findings in symptomatic IBD patients with a positive stool PCR. Our aim was to assess whether enteric infections in IBD patients are associated with disease activity.Methods: A retrospective observational cohort analysis of IBD patients with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis seen at HMH IBD Center from 2015 to 2020 who had stool PCR testing for diarrhea was performed. Data was collected on demographics including age, sex, disease subtype, disease location and endoscopic findings within 3 months of stool PCR. Patients without endoscopic findings within 3 months were excluded. Endoscopic scoring was converted to remission, mild, moderate or severe based on the Mayo endoscopic score or Rutgeert’s score and/or Crohn’s Disease Simple Endoscopic score. Results: There were 193 patients who had at least one stool PCR test for a total of 258 stool PCRs. Among these, an enteric infection was identified in 95(49.22%) of patients and 138(53.49%) of the PCR tests. Patients with an enteric infection were significantly less likely to have CD, 62 (44.93%) compared to 77 (64.1%) those without infection, (p=0.0077) (Table 1). There was a significant difference in endoscopic findings at three months with and without enteric infection (p=.017). Patients with disease located in either colon or small bowel alone were significantly associated with a positive stool PCR. An elevated lactoferrin was significantly associated with a positive stool PCR (p =0.02), but was not significant for an elevated fecal calprotectin. The most common infection identified was Clostridioides difficile in 65 (46.43%) followed by Enteropathogenic Escherichia Coli 19 (13.57%) (Table 2). Discussion: IBD patients in our study population showed that UC more than CD, those with colonic or small bowel disease alone, and having higher endoscopic severity within 3 months of testing, were more likely to have stool PCR positive for enteric infection, most commonly Clostridioides difficile and Escherichia coli. Our study shows that achieving endoscopic remission especially in those with UC or colonic disease can reduce the likelihood of enteric infections in our IBD patients.

    <p>Introduction: Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSC) are considered to be a promising new source for regenerative medicine. They are derived from wharton’s jelly, which is a gelatinous tissue located in the umbilical cord. It combines the benefits of adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells while avoiding the ethical and physical limitations of both. Specifically, WJMSCs have anti-tumoral properties and are immunosuppressant. Addtionally, WJMSC come with it’s own natural tissue construct, the wharton’s jelly itself which is loaded with rich extra-cellular matrices and proteins that aid in the growth and development of WJMSCs in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these properties are exciting for regenerative medicine and warrant investigation in order to further explore potential clinical applications of WJMSCs. Specifically within the lab of Dr. Triolo, WJMSC are currently being used in pioneering experiments to treat cleft palate in infants. In order to use the mesenchymal stem cells found within the wharton’s jelly for the treatment of cleft palate , the wharton’s jelly must first be isolated from the umbilical cord and the osteogenic differentiation potential of the WJMSC muse then be evaluated.Methods: The wharton’s jelly was isolated through a set protocol in which the umbilical cord is cleaned and divided into pieces of roughly 5-8 cm in length. The pieces were cleaned and opened, then the three vessels innate to the umbilical cord were removed. The wharton’s jelly was then scraped off the epithelial tissue and placed in phosphate buffer solution. The isolated Wharton’s jelly was then placed in both an osteogenic media and a control media and observed for mineralization after fourteen days using alizarin red staining. Results: The isolation method for wharton’s jelly from the umbilical cord was proven effective by the results of the wharton’s jelly in culture. After fourteen days, the plates containing wharton’s jelly within osteogenic media showed significant mineralization as indicated by the alizarin red staining. This was further verified by comparing the mineralization of the WJMSC in the osteogenic media with the WJMSC in the control media which showed no mineralization.  Conclusions: The results of this experiment reinforced the promising nature of WJMSC in clinical applications. The WJMSC showed strong differentiation potency in situ when placed in osteogenic media, showing clear signs of differentiation by its mineral deposits just after fourteen days. These results reinforce the ability of WJMSC to differentiate osteogenically and be used in clinical applications such as the treatment of cleft palate.
